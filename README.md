This dashboard provides an immediate, high-level overview of the entire admissions pipeline, summarizing key metrics such as the total number of applications received, the count of new applications awaiting review, and granular breakdowns of applications by status (e.g., admitted, rejected, pending review, waitlisted). Visual summaries can quickly highlight bottlenecks or areas requiring attention.

* **Application Management**: Administrators gain comprehensive control with the ability to view a detailed list of all submitted applications. Advanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities allow them to efficiently locate specific applications by various criteria such as student name, the specific course applied for, current application status, submission date range, or even by specific document completion. This ensures quick access to relevant data.

* **Applicant Details View**: For each application, administrators can access a detailed, consolidated view of the applicant's complete information. This includes all submitted forms, securely uploaded documents, and any communication history, facilitating thorough and informed evaluation without having to navigate multiple disparate systems or physical files.

* **Application Status Update**: This crucial feature enables administrators to easily change the status of an application at various stages of the admission process. Updating a status (e.g., from 'Pending' to 'Under Review', 'Admitted', 'Rejected', or 'Waitlisted') can trigger automated internal processes, such as moving the application to the next review queue, and automated notifications to the student, ensuring seamless progression and communication.

* **Communication Tools**: Administrators can send targeted messages or notifications to individual applicants or groups of applicants (e.g., all applicants for a specific course, or all applicants with a 'pending' status). This facilitates clear, efficient, and organized outreach for requests for more information, interview invitations, or official admission decisions.

* **Basic Reporting**: The system facilitates the generation of simple yet insightful reports based on real-time application data. These reports can provide quick overviews, such as the total count of applications per course, a detailed breakdown of application statuses across all programs, or the number of newly registered users within a specific period, offering valuable insights into admission trends and operational efficiency.

* **Course Management**: (Inferred from screenshots) Administrators have the capability to manage the list of available courses directly within the system. This includes adding new courses with their descriptions, editing existing course details (such as prerequisites or capacity), and potentially deactivating courses that are no longer offered, ensuring the course catalog presented to applicants is always accurate and up-to-date.

## Project Structure

The project's codebase is meticulously organized to promote modularity, maintainability, and ease of understanding for future development or collaboration. The main project folder, `cams/`, is designed with clear separation of concerns, typically residing within the `htdocs` directory of a local XAMPP installation.

## Setup Instructions

To set up CampusConnect on your local machine and get it running, please follow these detailed steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

* **XAMPP**: Before proceeding, you must download and install XAMPP from its official website: <https://www.apachefriends.org/>. XAMPP is an all-in-one package that provides the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL Database, and PHP Interpreter, which are essential for running this web application. Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the download.

### 2. Database Setup

1.  **Start XAMPP**: Launch the XAMPP control panel (usually found in your applications or program files). From there, ensure that both the **Apache** and **MySQL** services are started. You should see their status indicators turn green, confirming they are running correctly.

2.  **Create Database**:
    * Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`. This will open the phpMyAdmin interface, a web-based tool for managing MySQL databases, which comes bundled with XAMPP.
    * In the phpMyAdmin interface, locate and click on the "New" button (typically on the left sidebar, or you can go to the "Databases" tab and then click "Create database").
    * Enter `camsdb` as the database name in the designated field and click "Create". This action will create an empty database ready to hold your application's data.

3.  **Import Schema**:
    * Once the `camsdb` database is created, select it from the left-hand sidebar in phpMyAdmin to make it the active database.
    * Navigate to the "Import" tab at the top of the page.
    * Click on the "Choose File" button and locate the `camsdb.sql` file within the `database/` directory of your cloned project. This SQL file contains all the necessary table structures and initial data for CampusConnect.
    * After selecting the file, scroll down and click the "Go" button to import the database schema and any initial data that may be included in the SQL file. This will set up all the necessary tables for the application to function correctly.

### 3. Project Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Open your command line or terminal (e.g., Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux). Navigate to your XAMPP's `htdocs` directory. The default path is typically `C:/xampp/htdocs/` on Windows, `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/` on macOS, or `/opt/lampp/htdocs/` on Linux.
    ```bash
    cd C:/xampp/htdocs/ # Adjust this path if your XAMPP installation is different
    git clone [https://github.com/vivek71092/CampusConnect.git](https://github.com/vivek71092/CampusConnect.git) cams
    ```
    This command will clone the entire CampusConnect repository from GitHub into a new folder named `cams` inside your `htdocs` directory. It is crucial that the project folder is named `cams` for the application's internal paths and URL structure to function correctly without further configuration.

2.  **Configure Database Connection**:
    * Open the file `cams/includes/db_connect.php` (or `dbconnection.php`, depending on the specific file used in the provided source code) in a plain text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
    * Verify that the database connection details within this file accurately match your local MySQL setup. By default, for a fresh XAMPP installation, the MySQL username is `root`, and the password field is typically left empty (`""`). If you have configured a password for your MySQL `root` user, update it here.

    ```php
    <?php
    // Example: Simplified database connection
    $servername = "localhost"; // Usually 'localhost' for local XAMPP setup
    $username = "root"; // Your MySQL username (default for XAMPP is 'root')
    $password = ""; // Your MySQL password (default for XAMPP is empty)
    $dbname = "camsdb"; // The name of the database you created in phpMyAdmin

    // Create connection to the MySQL database
    $con = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    // Check connection for any errors during connection establishment
    if ($con->connect_error) {
        // If connection fails, terminate script and display error message
        die("Connection failed: " . $con->connect_error);
    }
    // Set character set to UTF-8 for proper encoding of data, preventing display issues
    $con->set_charset("utf8");
    ?>
    ```
    *Note: Pay close attention to the variable name used for the database connection. The PDF's conceptual example shows `$conn`, while the provided source code snippets use `$con`. Ensure consistency in your local setup to avoid connection issues and ensure data flows correctly.*

3.  **Set Permissions (if necessary)**:
    * For the application to successfully store uploaded documents (e.g., student transcripts, certificates), ensure that the `cams/uploads/` directory has appropriate write permissions. On Windows, this usually means ensuring your user account has full control over the folder. On Linux/macOS, you might need to use `chmod` commands (e.g., `chmod -R 775 cams/uploads`) to grant the web server (Apache) the necessary permissions to write files to this directory.

### 4. Accessing the Application

* Once all the above steps are completed and your Apache and MySQL services are confirmed to be running (green status in XAMPP control panel), open your web browser and navigate to the following URLs to access different parts of the application:
    * **Student Interface**: Access the main landing page or student login at `http://localhost/cams/` or `http://localhost/cams/index.php`. This is the primary entry point for prospective students.
    * **Admin Interface**: To access the administrative functionalities, navigate to the admin login page first, typically `http://localhost/cams/admin/` or `http://localhost/cams/admin/dashboard.php` (you will be redirected to login if not already authenticated). After successful login as an administrator, you will be directed to the admin dashboard, which serves as the central hub for managing admissions.
