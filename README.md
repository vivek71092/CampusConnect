## Getting Started

Follow these comprehensive steps to set up and run CampusConnect on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

To successfully run CampusConnect, you'll need a local server environment that includes **Apache** (as a web server) and **MySQL** (as a database server). We highly recommend using one of the following all-in-one packages:

* **XAMPP:** For Windows and Linux users.
* **WAMP:** Specifically for Windows users.
* **MAMP:** Specifically for macOS users.

**Important:** Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that both the **Apache** and **MySQL** services are actively running from your chosen local server's control panel.

### Installation and Running the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Navigate to your local server's web root directory, typically named `htdocs`.
    * **Windows (XAMPP):** `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
    * **macOS (XAMPP):** `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/`
    * **Linux (Apache):** `/var/www/html/`

    Once in the `htdocs` directory, clone the CampusConnect repository into a new folder named `cams`:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vivek71092/CampusConnect.git](https://github.com/vivek71092/CampusConnect.git) cams
    ```
    *If you've previously cloned the repository to a different location, simply move the `CampusConnect` folder into your `htdocs` directory and rename it to `cams`.*

2.  **Database Setup:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` to access the phpMyAdmin interface.
    * In phpMyAdmin, create a new database. Name this database `camsdb`.
    * From the left sidebar, select the newly created `camsdb` database.
    * Go to the "**Import**" tab located in the top navigation bar.
    * Click the "**Choose File**" button and select the `camsdb.sql` file. This file is located within the `database` folder of your cloned project (e.g., `cams/database/camsdb.sql`).
    * Click the "**Go**" button at the bottom of the page to import the SQL schema and initial data into your `camsdb` database.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    With Apache and MySQL services running and the database successfully imported, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL to access the CampusConnect application:

    ```
    http://localhost/cams
    ```
