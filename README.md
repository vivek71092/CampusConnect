Setup Instructions
To set up CampusConnect on your local machine and get it running, please follow these detailed steps:

1. Prerequisites
XAMPP: Before proceeding, you must download and install XAMPP from its official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/. XAMPP is an all-in-one package that provides the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL Database, and PHP Interpreter, which are essential for running this web application.

2. Database Setup
Start XAMPP: Launch the XAMPP control panel. From there, ensure that both the Apache and MySQL services are started. You should see their status indicators turn green.

Create Database:

Open your preferred web browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/. This will open the phpMyAdmin interface, a web-based tool for managing MySQL databases.

In the phpMyAdmin interface, locate and click on the "New" button (or "Databases" tab and then "Create database").

Enter camsdb as the database name and click "Create".

Import Schema:

Once the camsdb database is created, select it from the left-hand sidebar in phpMyAdmin.

Navigate to the "Import" tab at the top of the page.

Click on the "Choose File" button and locate the camsdb.sql file within the database/ directory of your cloned project.

After selecting the file, scroll down and click the "Go" button to import the database schema and any initial data that may be included in the SQL file. This will set up all the necessary tables for the application.

3. Project Deployment
Clone the Repository: Open your command line or terminal. Navigate to your XAMPP's htdocs directory. The default path is typically C:/xampp/htdocs/ on Windows.

cd C:/xampp/htdocs/ # Adjust this path if your XAMPP installation is different
git clone https://github.com/vivek71092/CampusConnect.git cams

This command will clone the entire CampusConnect repository into a new folder named cams inside your htdocs directory. It is crucial that the project folder is named cams for the application's internal paths to function correctly.

Configure Database Connection:

Open the file cams/includes/db_connect.php (or dbconnection.php, depending on the specific file used in the provided source code) in a text editor.

Verify that the database connection details within this file accurately match your local MySQL setup. By default, for a fresh XAMPP installation, the MySQL username is root, and the password field is left empty ("").

<?php
// Example: Simplified database connection
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root"; // Your MySQL username (default for XAMPP)
$password = ""; // Your MySQL password (default for XAMPP is empty)
$dbname = "camsdb"; // The name of the database you created

// Create connection
$con = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection for any errors during connection establishment
if ($con->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $con->connect_error);
}
// Set character set to UTF-8 for proper encoding of data
$con->set_charset("utf8");
?>

Note: Pay close attention to the variable name used for the database connection. The PDF's conceptual example shows $conn, while the provided source code snippets use $con. Ensure consistency in your local setup to avoid connection issues.

Set Permissions (if necessary):

For the application to successfully store uploaded documents, ensure that the cams/uploads/ directory has appropriate write permissions. On Windows, this usually means ensuring your user account has full control over the folder. On Linux/macOS, you might need to use chmod commands (e.g., chmod -R 775 cams/uploads).

4. Accessing the Application
Once all the above steps are completed and your Apache and MySQL services are running, open your web browser and navigate to the following URLs:

Student Interface: Access the main landing page or student login at http://localhost/cams/ or http://localhost/cams/index.php.

Admin Interface: To access the administrative functionalities, navigate to the admin login page first, typically http://localhost/cams/admin/ or http://localhost/cams/admin/dashboard.php (you will be redirected to login if not already authenticated). After successful login as an administrator, you will be directed to the admin dashboard.
